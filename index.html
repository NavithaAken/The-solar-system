        <h2 class="heading2">The composition of Solar System</h2>
        <h4><center><p class="even">The Solar System[d] is the gravitationally bound
            system of
            the Sun and the objects that orbit it.[11] It was formed about
            4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud
            collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc. The Sun is
            a typical star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the
            fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing this
            energy from its outer photosphere. Astronomers classify it as a
            G-type main-sequence star.</p></center></h4>

        <br>

       <h4><center><p class="odd">The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the
        eight planets.
        In order from the Sun, they are four terrestrial planets
        (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and
        Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). All
        terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant
        planets do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly
        composed of gases and liquids. Over 99.86% of the Solar System's
        mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass is in
        Jupiter and Saturn.</p></center></h4>

        <br>

       <h4><center><p class="even">The Solar System is constantly flooded by the
            Sun's charged particles, the solar wind, forming the
            heliosphere. Around 75–90 astronomical units from the Sun,[g]
            the solar wind is halted, resulting in the heliopause. This is
            the boundary of the Solar System to interstellar space. The
            outermost region of the Solar System is the theorized Oort
            cloud, the source for long-period comets, extending to a radius
            of 2,000–200,000 AU. The closest star to the Solar System,
            Proxima Centauri, is 4.25 light-years (269,000 AU) away. Both
            stars belong to the Milky Way galaxy.</p></center></h4>
